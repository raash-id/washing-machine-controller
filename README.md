# washing-machine-controller
Map the design specification of a washing machine to a finite state machine (FSM), and provide the right control signals. The washing machine has the following main state transition:idleà wash_fill à wash_agitate à wash_spin à rinse_fill à rinse_agitate àrinse_spin à idle. As the washing machine uses hot water to wash and code water to rinse, you need to use the state to control the two water valves accordingly. (a) Assign a binary vector for each state above (determine how many bits you need for each state).(b) Find a way to make the FSM robust so that the wash machine can handleaccidents appropriately. 2. Use Verilog HDL to describe your FSM3. Use Synopsys Design Compiler to synthesize your design4. Perform post-‐‐synthesize simulation on your synthesized netlist and identify TWO voltage glitches in your simulated waveform5. Analyze the reason for the two voltage glitches6.
